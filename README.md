# Footer Fade

This is a proof of concept for showing the logo in a fixed navigation bar after the logo at the top of the page scrolls out of view. It was going to be used on a project, but the design changed. I like the interaction, though.

This version uses JavaScript (and jQuery) to check scroll position (based on dimensions of the logo) and animation the bottom logo into view. This is done by animating both the opacity and bottom positioning.
